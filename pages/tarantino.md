## A Royale With Cheese

### How Quentin Tarantino's moives affected my views on film

I was about 13-years-old when I first saw “Kill Bill: Volume 1.” I was staying at a friend’s house when his parents had left us at the house alone for a few hours. I remember my friend waiting a few moments to make sure they were gone and then going to his parents' movie collection and pulling out the bright yellow box of the Kill Bill VHS. We devoured the movie and its nearly 2 hour runtime. I remember seeing that the movie was written and directed by the same man by the name of Quentin Tarantino. I was still a few years out from having complete autonomy over what movies I was able to see and own, but I remember thinking that day that I wanted to see any movie that man was involved in.

A year later I was finally able to see “Kill Bill: Volume 2” and it was just as mesmerizing as Volume 1. By this time I had become aware of Tarantino’s other movies. I knew his first widely seen film was called “Reservoir Dogs” and I also knew that his biggest movie was called “Pulp Fiction.” I don’t remember exactly when I saw “Pulp Fiction” but I remember still being in my mid-teens and finding it to be a transcendent movie experience. I had never seen anything like it. I had never paid so much attention to the rhythm and content of a movie’s dialog. The way the movie jumped between different story lines before connecting them all back together blew my mind.

I was working at a movie theater in 2009 when “Inglourious Basterds”, Tarantino’s alternate history take on World War II, came out. Again I was floored by the dialog and set pieces that the film offered up. The same could be said again just three years later when Tarantino released his take on a western with “Django Unchained.” By this point I was firmly entrenched that Tarantino was my favorite movie Director/Writer.

The year that “Django Unchained” released marked 20 years since Tarantino had released “Reservoir Dogs,” his first film. I remember being online one day when Amazon’s all knowing algorithm put this box set in front of my eyes. It commemorated Tarantino's first 20 years as a filmmaker and included every movie he had written from “Inglourious Basterds” all the way back to “Reservoir Dogs.” I bought it immediately. When It finally arrived I stared at the art inside and outside of the box. Some of Tarantino’s most iconic characters adorned the box.

This box set allowed me to own some of my most favorite movies and also to see some of Taratino’s lesser thought of movies like “Jackie Brown,” and also movies he only wrote like “True Romance.” This box set is my favorite item in my collection because it represents a lot of what I love in movies. Tarantino’s movies also represent a change in my life. They changed me from a kid who mostly just watched Star Wars, to a person who really appreciates movies as an art form and is willing to explore in my interests.
