## In A Galaxy Not So Far Away

### How the Star Wars Saga shaped my love of movies

This box set of Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga holds a special place in my heart, even though you can stream all the movies online these days. The first movie I ever remember seeing is The Empire Strikes Back. I was probably around five or six years old at the time and I remember being completely captivated by Luke flying the snowspeeder during the attack on Hoth. From that moment on I was hooked. I watched the original trilogy on repeat for most of the next year or two. But more than anything was who I got to watch the movies with. The reason I was able to watch the movies on repeat was because my father owned the VHS box set of the trilogy. Often times he would come home from work at night and see that I was watching Return of the Jedi (my favorite) or one of the other films, and even though he would be tired from a long day at work he would sit down and finish them movie with me. These were always movie memories that stood out to me and what made me a lifelong fan of not just movies, but Star Wars in particular.

Then in 1999, when I was just eight-years-old, The Phantom Menace came out and me and my dad got to experience a whole new Star Wars adventure together for the first time. To this day this is one of my favorite movie going experiences. It doesn't matter that in later years I would come to have a less favorable view of the movie. On that day it was the greatest movie I had ever seen because me and my dad got to see a brand new Star Wars adventure. Just three years later we again went together to go see the next chapter in the prequel trilogy. I was a bit older at this point but it was no less special than in 1999. I remember leaving the theater with both of us talking excitedly about how cool it was to see Yoda in a lightsaber dual.

However, just another three years later, when I was 14-years-old, seeing Revenge of the Sith held a different meaning. The month before the movie was released my mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and a couple of weeks later underwent surgery. The surgery was successful and my mother has been cancer free since, however, for the two weeks leading up to the movie's release my mother was recovering in the hospital and my dad stayed by her side the whole time. Although, on the day the movie came out my dad took a few hours away from my mom to take me to see the movie. I had not seen him for days and the movie was an opportunity for both of us to be with each other and escape into another galaxy for a couple of hours. I still have the movie tickets from that day.

We thought Revenge of the Sith would be the last time we would ever see a new Star Wars movie. But when Disney bought Lucasfilm in 2012 we knew there would be more to come. I was 24 when The Force Awakens released in 2015, and again my father and I went to go see the film together. Even though I was an adult at this time it made it no less special to again sit with my dad and see Han Solo and Princess Leia back on screen after more than 15 years since we first watched them in our living room. I went to see the next two movies in the sequel trilogy with my father as well, and even though I don't like the movies as much as the previous ones, they were still special moments with my father.

This box set represents more to me than just a collection of films. It represents some of my most cherished movie memories. Today, when I feel the urge to watch one of these movies I just turn on Disney+ and stream it, but it is still important for me to own physical copies of the complete collection. It reminds me of the VHS box set that started it all twenty-five years ago.
